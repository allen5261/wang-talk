# 20171231-我国首条承载式光伏公路建成通车
2017年12月28日，由我国完全自主知识产权研发与铺设的全球首段光伏高速公路在山东济南亮相。目前，半透明的路面已铺设完毕，一些车辆已经开始在路面上进行测试。那么，这段公路到底有多神奇？交通产业跟新能源产业组合在一起，又会会擦出什么样的火花？

这种路面的全称是承载式高速光伏路面 ，最上面一层是类似毛玻璃的半透明新型材料，摩擦系数高于传统沥青路面。在保证轮胎不打滑的同时，还拥有较高的透光率，可以让阳光穿透它，使下面的太阳能电池把光能转换成电能，实时输送上电网，就好像一个巨大的“充电宝”。在冬季，这段路面还可以将光能转化为热能，消融冰冻积雪，确保行车安全。

目前，路面下还预留了电磁感应线圈。未来，随着电动汽车无线技术的配套，可实现电动汽车在此路段行驶过程中，边跑边充电，再也不用担心电池不够用了。 

此外，这段光伏路面不只是将太阳能转化电能上网这么简单，预留的信息化端口未来还可接入各种信息采集设备，车辆信息、拥堵状况等信息将汇聚成交通大数据，成为智慧城市的一部分。

就如齐鲁交通发展集团董事长徐春福所说：“这是整个的一个大的跨界的融合，我感到也是一个前瞻性的，也带某种程度颠覆性的革命。”

On December 28, 2017, the world's first _photovoltaic_(太阳能光伏) highway which has China's full _independent intellectual property rights_(自主知识产权) has been developed and laid in Jinan. At present, the road surface has been laid, some _vehicles_(车辆) have begun to test on the road surface. So, how amazing is this road? What will happen when the transportation and new energy technology _combine_(结合) together?

The full name of this road is Carrying High Speed Road. Its surface is _semi-transparent_(半透明的) new material like the wool glass, its _friction coefficient_(摩擦系数) is higher than the traditional road. It can not only make sure that the car won't slip, but also allows sunlight to penetrat well. The cell under the road converts light into electricity, at the same time, it can put the electricity onto the powerline, just like a huge "Power Bank". In winter, the road can also convert light into heat, _melting_(融化) snow and keeping driving safety. 

Currently, _electromagnetic induction coils_(电磁感应线圈) have been also reserved under the road surface. In the future, with the wireless charging technology, electric cars can be charged while running along the road, and no longer need to worry about the low battery. 

In addition, this road can not only convert light into electricity, but the reserved information port can also connect all kinds of information collection devices, information can be converted to traffic big data, such as vehicle information, road condition, etc.. The big data will become a part of intelligent city. 

As Xu Chunfu, the chairman of the Qilu Traffic Development Group say: "This is a large _crossover_(跨界合作), I feel like this is forward-looking, also with a certain subversive revolution."
